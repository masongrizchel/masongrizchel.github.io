### Research Vision-Mission Statement
Decades or even centuries ago, most of the observations in astronomy with the application of physics focused more on the optical window of electromagnetic radiation.

I aim to measure RFI values with interference caused by different factors and their utilization to perform RFI measurements to determine whether the chosen site is suitable for radio astronomy observations within a 21 cm hydrogen line ~ 1420.4 MHz.

The measurement of RFI in a selected region in the Philippines can provide an open window for different people to explore radio astronomy observation as we look at the same sky. The discovery of radio astronomy led to a further understanding of the universe's age and cosmic microwave background and even served as a test to the theories formulated decades ago.
