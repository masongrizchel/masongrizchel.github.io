> "Sapiens qui prospicit" - Personal Mantra

<justify> Hello, and welcome to my website! I'm Rizchel, an MSc Physics (candidate) dedicated to exploring the universe at radio frequencies! I'm a former artificial intelligence officer and currently a data-driven astrophysics advocate. </justify>

<justify> Beyond my academic/research background, I'm a freelance, on-call AI/astrophysics lecturer and a part-time history & philosophy of science instructor: a former Artificial Intelligence (AI) Officer and an AI Automation Hobbyist. I'm also an aspiring Stand-Up Comedian. </justify>

I will also showcase some of the work I have been doing and am currently working on, including my educational and professional endeavors. Please join me on this journey (by joining my bi-monthly newsletters) and regular blog postings via Ko-fi, and feel free to contact me with any questions or comments. You can find all my social media links below my profile picture. </justify>
