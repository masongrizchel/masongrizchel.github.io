## As a physics teacher

To me, physics is one of the most interesting subjects that I have encountered. 
It studies energy and matter, exploring their intricacies from the minutest particles to the grandest scales. This most fundamental, comprehensive, and beautiful discipline became part of me and goes beyond the universal scale. When I had the chance to study it further, I was fortunate enough to have the best teachers/professors, which piqued my interest further.
Making one of the most challenging subjects come alive makes me appreciate its essence and elegance.
