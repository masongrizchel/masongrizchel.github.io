## As a physics teacher

To me, physics is one of the most interesting subjects that I have encountered.Â 
It delves into the realms of energy and matter, exploring their intricacies from the minutest particles to the grandest scales. The most fundamental, comprehensive, and the most beautiful discipline that became part of me. When I have the chance to study it further, I was fortunate enough to have the best teachers/professors which piqued further my interest.
Making one of the toughest subjects come alive makes me appreciate its essence as well as its elegance.
