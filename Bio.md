Hi, I'm Rizchel from Valenzuela City, where I completed high school before fate led me to Physics and Artificial Intelligence.

I received an education degree in 2015 at Pamantasan ng Lungsod ng Valenzuela. Eventually, I followed my dream and passion to pursue physics by taking an MS in Physics at De La Salle University. 

I was privileged to spearhead the university's community extension service during my baccalaureate degree. And during my thesis journey, I was chosen as the best presenter.

I was included in various projects when I became part of the MS Physics pool. Also, I became a member of the OPTICS Research Group.

Here are some of my memorable experiences throughout my academic and professional journey:
-	Above Average Evaluation – AI Officer, Oct 2024
- Outstanding Teaching Evaluation – De La Salle Araneta University, 2023
- Best Presentation – 8th Southeast Asian Astronomy Network, 2018
- Semi-Finalist – Young Science Prize, Dept. of Science & Technology, 2018
- Best Paper – Graduate Student Council Research Congress, 2017
- Best Presentation – Graduate Student Council Research Congress, 2017
- Passer, Licensure Examination for Teachers (LPT) – September 2015
- Community Development Awardee – Pamantasan ng Lungsod ng Valenzuela, 2015
- Best Presenter – College of Education, Science Department, Pamantasan ng Lungsod ng Valenzuela, 2014

I am a former AI Officer in one of the most prominent lodging industries in the Philippines.

I work as a freelance and part-time astronomy/physics lecturer and a part-time STS/HPS instructor.
