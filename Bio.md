Hi, I'm Rizchel from Valenzuela City where I completed my high school before fate led me to Physics and Artificial Intelligence.

I received an education degree in 2015 at Pamantasan ng Lungsod ng Valenzuela. Eventually, I followed my dream and passion to pursue physics by taking an MS in Physics at De La Salle University. 

During my baccalaureate degree, I had the privilege to spearhead the community extension service of the university. And during my thesis journey, I was able to be chosen as the best presenter.

When I became part of the pool of MS Physics, I had the privilege to be included in various projects. Also, became a member of the OPTICS Research Group.

Here are some of my memorable experiences throughout my academic journey:
- Outstanding Teaching Evaluation during 1st Term of A.Y. 2022-2023, De La Salle Araneta University, 2023
- Semi-Finalist, Young Science Price â€“ Department of Science and Technology, 2018
- Best Paper, Graduate Student Council Research Congress, De La Salle University, Manila, Philippines, 2017
- Best Presentation, Graduate Student Council Research Congress, De La Salle University, Manila, Philippines, 2017
- Community Development Awardee, Pamantasan ng Lungsod ng Valenzuela, Valenzuela City, Philippines, 2015
- Best Presenter, College of Education, Science Department, Pamantasan ng Lungsod ng Valenzuela, Valenzuela City, Philippines, 2014

Now, I am an AI Officer in one of the biggest lodging industries in the Philippines.
